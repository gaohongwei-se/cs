Entity, How to find out
  an nouns or a thing in the business description
  exists independently 
  physically or logically. 
  can be uniquely identified

  For example,
    book: isbn, title, fname, lname
    Book has authors(fname, lname) as attributes
    But authors(fname, lname) exists independently of book
    So authors shoud be an entity
