  # Restraunt Order (as a group or individual)
    Menu:   id, name, price
    Table:  id, name, size
    Server: id, name, last_name
    Order: table_id, time, status(open:closed), server_id
    OrderItem: order_id, menu_id, count, customer_id

  If customers pay seperately, they will have different customer_id, 
  for example, 1 to 10 for each customer;
  But customer_id is only temporarily represent each one, 
  for example, by position
    
  Otherwise customer_id is the same within an order
