  # Restraunt Order as a group
    Menu: id, name, price
    Table: id, name, size
    Order: table_id, time, status(open:closed)
    OrderItem: order_id, menu_id, count, customer_id

  If customers pay seperately, they will have different customer_id, 
  for example, 1 to 10 for each customer;
  But customer_id is only temporarily represent each one, 
  for example, by position
    
  Otherwise customer_id is the same within an order
